Base font-size for rem calculation

For TV applications, it's recommended to use relative values to the screen size
rather than fixed pixel values. This ensures proper scaling across different TV resolutions
(HD, Full HD, 4K, 8K) and screen sizes.

Using rem units allows us to:
- Scale all UI elements proportionally by changing a single base value
- Maintain consistent visual hierarchy across different screen sizes
- Avoid having to rewrite every single property for each breakpoint
- Ensure better readability and usability on large displays

The base font-size is adjusted via media queries to scale the entire UI
automatically for different resolutions.

html {
  font-size: 10px; // 1rem = 10px (base for smaller screens)
}

// Scale up rem for larger screens (Full HD and above)
@media (min-width: 1920px) {
  html {
    font-size: 16px; // 1rem = 16px (optimal for Full HD TVs and larger)
  }
